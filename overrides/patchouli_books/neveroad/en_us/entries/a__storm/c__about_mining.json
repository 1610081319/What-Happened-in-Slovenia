Half an hour is definitely enough and then you should straightly go to fight against the Battle Tower and summon the Wither Storm for the AoA3's gameplay."

I know you probably got hooked on digging the ores and ores and ores while exploring the caves, but one hour is the eventual limit!$(br2)    Well, however, just a suggestion you're not forced to follow.
